# Your Music Playlist

This application shows you what songs are in my current favorites playlist. It is an interactive app that allows you to change, add and remove songs from the playlist.

## Setting Up 

You will need to fork and clone [This JSON server](https://github.com/marthaeochoa/json-server-template) repo into your machine and run it.

Fork and clone this repo then cd into the file.\
Run `npm start`

To view in your browser. (You will have to type `y` when prompted since localhost:3000 is already in use).

## Usage

Application opens up a Home tab. Once you read it and click on the `See Playlist` button, the playlist will appear on the screen.

Over the playlist are filter buttons that allow you to filter the songs by genre.\
On the right of each song is a delete button, which allows you to remove any song you want from this playlist.\
On the navigation, up top, there is a `Add New Song` button, this button takes you to a page where you will be allowed to input your own favorite song!

Have fun!
